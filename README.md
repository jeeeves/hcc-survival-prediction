## Project Overview

This project develops a clinical decision support tool for predicting 1-year survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, with a focus on model interpretability and clinical applicability.

HCC has poor prognosis, with many patients surviving less than one year after diagnosis. Accurate 1-year survival prediction enables clinicians to:
- Avoid futile aggressive treatments for patients unlikely to benefit
- Prioritise curative interventions (surgery, transplant) for good prognosis patients
- Guide palliative care and end-of-life planning appropriately

For patients and families, early prognostic information supports informed decision-making about treatment options, quality of life priorities, and realistic care planning.

## Dataset

- **Source**: University Hospital, Portugal
- **Patients**: 165 diagnosed HCC patients  
- **Features**: 49 clinical variables following EASL-EORTC guidelines
- **Target**: 1-year survival (binary classification)

## Project Goals

1. **Clinical Understanding**: Develop domain knowledge in HCC and liver disease
2. **Data Quality Assessment**: Rigorously evaluate and handle missing data
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build interpretable models for survival prediction
4. **Clinical Insights**: Generate actionable insights for healthcare providers
5. **Professional Documentation**: Demonstrate best practices in healthcare analytics

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, shap
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
