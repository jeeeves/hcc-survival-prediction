# Feature Categories and Clinical Relevance

## Demographic Features
- **Age**: Older patients have typically worse survival due to reduced phsyiological reserves, comorbidities, and lower tolerance for aggressive treatments like surgery or chemotherapy.
- **Gender**: HCC survival among males is lower compared to females, possibly due to better adherence to HCC surveillance compared to men. 

## Risk Factors (Causes of HCC)
- **Hepatitis B&C markers (HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAb, HCVAb)**: Persistent HBsAg positivity relects continue liver injury and reduced immune control, which can lean to lower 1-year survival. Similar to HBsAg, HBeAg positivity reflects poorer 1-year survival due to active viral replication and immune tolerance -> faster progression of cirrhosis and more aggressive tumour behaviour. HBcAb positivity alone is not a strong direct predictor of survival, but given reactivation risk, is prognostic, similar to HCVAb positivity.

- **Cirrhosis**: Creates a pro-carcinogenic environment with chronic inflammation, DNA damage, and disordered degeneration, which is why 80-90% of HCC cases develop in cirrhotic livers. Once HCC develops, cirrhosis also limits liver reserve and treatment options, leading to a worse 1-year survival rate.

- **Lifestyle factors (e.g. diabetes, alcohol, smoking, obesity)**: All of these factors accelerate chronic liver injury through toxic metabolites (e.g. acetaldehye), inflammation, and metabolic stress, promoting fibrosis and HCC development. Once HCC occurs, these factors worsen baseline liver function and comorbidity burden, limiting treatment tolerance and increasing early decompensation -> poorer 1-year survival, independent of tumour stage.

- **Nonalcoholic Statohepatitis (NASH)**: Advanced form of NAFLD, marked by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and NASH-related HCC often presents late and may occur without cirrhosis, while metabolic comorbidities and poor hepatic reserve limit treatment options -> worse 1-year survival.

- **Hemochromatosis**: Genetic iron overload causes oxidative stress and DNA damage in hepatocytes, and untreated hemochromatosis carries an increased HCC risk. Once HCC develops, advanced cirrhosis and iron-related organ damage often limit treatment options -> worse 1-year survival.

- **Endemic Countries**: In HBV-endemic regions, infection is often acquired at birth, leading to decades of chronic inflammation and earlier onset of HCC. While this increases lifestyle HCC risk, endemic exposure alone does not strongly worsen 1-year survival - short term outcomes are driven more by other factors like tumour stage, liver function and access to treatment than by geography or mode of infection.

## Lifestyle Factors
- **Alcohol**: Alcohol causes hepatocyte injury through toxic acetaldehyde production, leading to inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis. In HCC patients, alcohol-related liver damage reduces hepatic reserve and increases the risk of liver failure. This limits treatment options and is associated with poorer one-year survival outcomes.

- **Smoking**: Smoking introduces carcinogens that increase oxidative stress and DNA damage, compounding liver injury from other HCC risk factors. In patients with chronic liver disease, smoking is associated with more aggressive disease and reduced treatment tolerance. This contributes to poorer 1-year survival outcomes in HCC patients.

- **Diabetes**: Diabetes promotes insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, stimulating hepatocyte proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. It is strongly associated with fatty liver disease, a key driver of HCC. In HCC patients, diabetes worsens systemic health and liver recovery, contributing to reduced one-year survival.

- **Obesity**: Obesity promotes HCC through NAFLD and NASH, which can progress to cirrhosis. It is associated with chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction that support tumour growth. In HCC patientes, obesity worsens comorbidites and treatment tolerance, contributing to poorer one-year survival.

## Liver Function Tests
- **Bilirubin (Total & Direct)**: Bilirubin reflects the liver's ability to clear and excrete waste products. Elevated levels indicate advanced liver dysfunction, or bile obstruction by tumour. High bilirubin predicts poor 1-year survival and limits eligibility for curative treatments.

- **ALT & AST**: ALT and AST indicate active hepatocyte injury. Elevated levels reflect ongoing inflammation from hepatitis, alcohol, or tumour burden. Although indirect, persistent elevation signals reduced liver reserve and poorer one-year survival.

- **GGT**: GGT reflects bile duct injury and chronic liver inflammation. Elevated levels are associated with alcohol use, cholestasis and tumour progression. High GGT correlates with poorer disease outcomes and reduced one year survival.

- **ALP**: ALP is a marker of bile duct obstruction or cholestasis. Elevated levels in HCC suggest tumour-related biliary involvement. This is associated with advanced disease and poorer one-year survival.

- **Albumin**: Albumin reflects the liver's protein synthetic function. Low levels indicate advanced liver failure and poor physiological reserve. Hypoalbuminemia strongly predicts reduced one year survival in HCC patients.

- **INR (International Normalised Ratio)**: INR reflects the liver's ability to produce clotting factors. Elevated INR indicates severe liver dysfunction and bleeding risk. It strongly predicts poor one-year survival and limits treatment options.

- **Total Proteins**: Total protein reflects overall protein synthesis and nutritional status. Low levels suggest advanced liver disease or malnutrition. This is associated with reduced treatment tolerance and poorer one-year survival.

- **Creatinine**: Creatinine reflects kidney function, which is often impaired in advanced liver disease. Elevated levels indicate hepatorenal dysfunction and poor physiological reserve. High creatinine strongly predicts reduced one-year survival.

## Tumour Characteristics
- **AFP**: AFP is a tumour biomarker re-expressed in HCC due to malignant hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Elevated AFT levels are associated with vascular invasion, poor differentiation, and increased recurrence risk. High AFT is a strong indicator of aggressive tumour biology and reduced 1-year survival, although a subset of HCC cases remains AFP-negative.

- **Number of nodules**: The number of tumour nodules reflects the extent of intrahepatic disease spread. Multiple nodules are associated with increased tumour burden, higher likelihood of intrahepatic metastasis, and limited eligibility for curative therapies. Increasing nodule count ie linked to poorer short-term survival outcomes in HCC.

- **Major Dimension**: Tumour size is a key indicator of disease progression in HCC. Larger tumours are associated with vascular invasion, metastatic potential, and reduced response to curative therapies. Increasing tumour dimension is strongly linked to worse 1-year survival outcomes.

- **Radiological Hallmark**: HCC exhibits a characteristic imaging pattern of arterial phase hyperenhancement with venous or delayed washout. This radiological hallmark enables non-invasive diagnosis and accurate staging. Early radiological identification supports timely treatment, indirectly impacting short-term survival outcomes.

- **Metastasis**: Metastatic disease indicates advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with systemic tumour spread. It is associated with limited treatment options and significantly reduced survival. The presence of metastasis is a strong predictor of poor 1-year survival.

## Complications / Disease Severity
- **Performance Status**: Performance Status reflects a patient's functional ability and overall physiological reserve. Poor PS is associated with reduced tolerance to treatment and higher mortality independent of tumour burden. Patients with PS >= 2 are often ineligible for curative therapies and have worse 1-year survival outcomes.

- **Ascites degree**: Ascites indicates advanced liver dysfunction and portal hypertension. Increasing ascites severity reflects decompensated cirrhosis and limits eligibility for curative treatments. The presence of moderate to severe ascites is associated with poor short-term survival in HCC.

- **Encephalopathy degree**: Hepatic encephalopathy reflects impaired toxin clearance due to advanced liver failure. Increasing severity is associated with cognitive dysfunction, reduced treatment eligibility, and high short-term mortality. Its presence is a strong negative predictor of 1-year survival. 

- **Esophageal Varices**: Esophageal varices result from portal hypertension due to advanced liver disease. Their presence indicates severe vascular complications and increased risk of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. Varices are associated with worse prognosis and reduced short-term survival.

- **Portal hypertension**: Portal hypertension reflects increased vascular resistance due to cirrhotic liver damage. It leads to major complications such as ascites and varices and increases procedural bleeding risk. Severe portal hypertension is associated with limited treatment options and poorer 1-year survival.

- **Portal Vein Thrombosis**: Portal vein thrombosis indicates vascular involvement and advanced disease. It impairs hepatic blood flow, worsens portal hypertension, and excludes liver transplantation. The presence of PVT is strongly associated with poor 1-year survival outcomes.

- **Splenomegaly**: Splenomegaly results from chronic portal hypertension and is associated with thrombocyotpenia. Reduced platelet counts increase bleeding risk and limit invasive treatments. its presence reflets advanced liver disease and poorer prognosis.

## Comorbidities
- **Arterial Hypertension(AHT)**: Arterial hypertension reflects chronic cardiovascular stress. Poorly controlled AHT increases perioperative and treatment complications. It indirectly reduces 1-year survival HCC by limiting safe intervention options.

- **Chronic Renal Insufficiency(CRI)**: Chronic renal insufficiency indicates impaired kidney function, limiting treatment options and increasing the risk of complications. CRI combined with liver disease is associated with significantly reduced 1-year survival in HCC.

- **HIV**: HIV infection causes immunosuppression, increasing infection risk and accelerating disease progression. HIV-positive patients have higher treatment complications and poorer 1-year survival in HCC.

**Obesity** and **Diabetes** were already covered in another section.

## Hematological Markers
- **Hemoglobin**: Hemoglobin reflects oxygen-carrying capacity. Low levels impair treatment tolerance and organ function, contributing to worse short-term survival in HCC.

- **Mean Corpuscular Volume(MCV)**: MCV indicates red blood cell size and reflects nutritional status or chronic liver injury. Abnormal MCV suggests higher risk of complications and may negatively influence short-term survival in HCC.

- **Leukocytes**: Leukocyte count reflects immune function and inflammatory status. Abnormal counts increase infection risk and treatment complications, impacting 1-year survival in HCC negatively.

- **Platelets**: Platelet count reflects clotting capacity and liver disease severity. Low platelet levels increase procedural bleeding risk and are associated with reduced 1-year survival.

## Other Labaratory Values
- **Iron and Ferritin**: Iron and ferritin levels indicate iron metabolism and nutritional status. Abnormal values reflect chronic liver injury or malnutrition and are linked to worse 1-year survival in HCC.

- **Oxygen Saturation**: Oxygen saturation reflects lung function and systemic oxygen delivery. Low saturation indicates hepatopulmonary complications and worsened prognosis, decreasing 1-year survival in HCC.
