# Clinical background: Hepatocellular carcinoma

## What is HCC?

HCC is a primary tumour of the liver and constitutes more than 90% of the primary tumour of the liver.

## Who Gets HCC?
### Risk Factors
- Viral Hepatitis (hepatitis B and C)
- Alcoholic Liver Disease
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- Cirrhosis

### Demographics
- More common in men than women (thrice as common)
- Occurs in developing countries such as Sub-Sahara Africa, South-East Asia and China (all have high burdens of hepatitis B viral infection).
- Typically affects middle-aged to older adults.


## Why Predict 1-Year Survival?
### Clinical Significance
Predicting 1-year survival in HCC is very important because the disease has a poor overall prognosis, with a low 5-year survival rate. Early identification of patients with limited short-term survival can help clinicians avoid futile, aggressive treatments and instead focus on care strategies aligned with patient benefit. For patients, this information supports informed decision-making, realistic expectations and appropriate care planning.

### Treatment Implications
Predicted 1-year survival can directly guide treatment selection in HCC. Patients with a higher likelihood of surviving beyond one year may be considered for aggressive or resource-intensive treatments such as liver transplants or systemic therapies, while those with poor predicted survival may benefit from more symptom-focused or palliative approaches. This allows treatments to be better matched to expected benefit and patient condition.
